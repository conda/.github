# The conda Organization
conda is an open source organization and the community behind conda, conda-incubator, and conda-archive.<br>
All interactions within the conda Organization are governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#the-short-version).<br>
For questions and discussions you can join the [conda discourse group](https://conda.discourse.group/), and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/condaproject) for updates on latest developments in conda.
