# The conda Organization
Conda is an open-source organization and the community behind the [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) package manager.

The conda community is composed of three organizations here on GitHub:
- [conda](https://github.com/conda): where officially supported projects live
- [conda-incubator](https://github.com/conda-incubator): where community incubated projects live
- [conda-archive](https://github.com/conda-archive): where inactive and archived projects live

The flowchart below explains how projects move within these organizations:

Note that projects may also be directly added to the conda organization upon request to the steering council.
