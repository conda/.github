# The conda Organization
Conda is an open-source organization and the community behind the [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) package manager.

The conda community is composed of three organizations here on GitHub:
- [conda](https://github.com/conda): where officially supported projects live
- [conda-incubator](https://github.com/conda-incubator): where community incubated projects live
- [conda-archive](https://github.com/conda-archive): where inactive and archived projects live

All interactions within the conda Organization are governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/conda-incubator/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#the-short-version).<br>

We encourage community members to provide feedback and proposals for making conda better, and all major changes should be submitted as [Conda Enhancement Proposals (CEPs)](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps).</br>

For questions and discussions please join our [conda discourse group](https://conda.discourse.group/). <br>

You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/condaproject) for updates on latest developments in conda.
