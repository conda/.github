# The conda Organization
Conda is an open-source organization and the community behind the [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) package manager.

The conda community is composed of three organizations here on GitHub:
- [conda](https://github.com/conda): where officially supported projects live
- [conda-incubator](https://github.com/conda-incubator): where community incubated projects live
- [conda-archive](https://github.com/conda-archive): where inactive and archived projects live

### Important Repositories

- [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda)
- [conda-build](https://github.com/conda/conda-build)

### Important Community Places

- [CEPs](https://github.com/conda-incubator/ceps): Conda Enhancement Proposals
